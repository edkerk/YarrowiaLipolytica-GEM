Yarrowia-GEM
========================

This repository contains the current genome-scale model of _Yarrowia lipolytica_ used in the @SysBioChalmers group, initially 
published in
>Kerkhoven EJ, Pomraning KR, Baker SE, Nielsen J (2016) Regulation of amino-acid metabolism controls flux to lipid accumulation in Yarrowia lipolytica. npj Syst Biol Appl 2:16005. doi: [10.1038/npjsba.2016.5](http://www.nature.com/articles/npjsba20165).

The model is based on the [Yeast7.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yeast/) consensus metabolic model, with additional curation specific for _Y. lipolytica_ and with the massive extension of lipid metabolism (introduced in Yeast7) partly reverted. The model was generated in RAVEN and exported as COBRA SBML L3V1 FBCv2.

This repository is administered by Eduard Kerkhoven (@edkerk), Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology.
